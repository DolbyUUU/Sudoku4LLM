# Sudoku4LLM: A Dataset Generator for Training and Evaluating Reasoning LLMs

## üöÄ Motivation

As **reasoning capabilities** in Large Language Models (LLMs) continue to advance, the need for high-quality, structured datasets has become increasingly critical. While most datasets focus on linguistic tasks, reasoning over **structured or semi-structured data** remains an underexplored frontier in LLM research. **Sudoku4LLM** addresses this gap by providing a systematic, scalable, and flexible Sudoku dataset generator tailored for **training, fine-tuning, and evaluating reasoning LLMs**.

Sudoku is particularly well-suited for this purpose because it combines **logical reasoning** and **structured data representation** in a way that is both challenging and easy to verify. With Sudoku puzzles, we can simulate tasks that require multi-step reasoning, curriculum learning, and structured data serialization, all of which are essential for advancing reasoning capabilities in LLMs.

By leveraging Sudoku puzzles, **Sudoku4LLM** enables researchers and practitioners to explore and optimize reasoning-focused LLMs in a way that natural language datasets often cannot. The project is designed to support experiments in **structured data reasoning**, **Chain of Thought (CoT) prompting**, and **tabular data serialization**.

## üéØ Why Use Sudoku for Reasoning LLMs?

Sudoku puzzles are more than just a game‚Äîthey are a **rich reasoning benchmark** with unique properties that make them ideal for training and evaluating LLMs:

### 1. **Multi-Dimensional Difficulty Levels**
   - Sudoku puzzles offer multiple axes of difficulty:
     - **Grid Size:** Supports 4√ó4, 6√ó6, and 9√ó9 puzzles, each requiring progressively more reasoning steps.
     - **Percent of Missing Numbers:** Difficulty increases as more cells are left unfilled.
     - **Solution Uniqueness:** Puzzles can be configured with unique or multiple solutions.
   - This flexibility allows for fine-grained control over task complexity.

### 2. **Controlled Curriculum Learning**
   - The structured difficulty levels make Sudoku an excellent candidate for **curriculum learning**, where training progresses from simple to complex tasks.
   - Researchers can control the **length of the Chain of Thought (CoT)** required by the model, enabling targeted reasoning experiments.

### 3. **Ease of Verification**
   - Sudoku has a **well-defined solution space**, making it easy to evaluate model outputs:
     - Fully correct solutions can be verified against the ground truth.
     - Partial correctness can be assessed by counting valid rows, columns, or sub-grids.
   - This makes Sudoku puzzles ideal for reinforcement learning with rule-based rewards.

### 4. **Structured Data Format**
   - Unlike text-based tasks, Sudoku puzzles are inherently **structured**:
     - Grids can be serialized in multiple ways (e.g., cell-level, row-level, or grid-level).
     - This allows researchers to explore the **optimal input format for structured data** in LLMs.
   - Sudoku4LLM supports 11 different serialization formats, making it a versatile tool for studying structured data representation.

### 5. **Resistance to Memorization**
   - With **infinite variability** in puzzle generation, Sudoku puzzles are highly resistant to memorization, ensuring that models are genuinely reasoning rather than recalling.

### 6. **Systematic Generation**
   - Puzzles are generated using **logic-based templates**, ensuring consistency and reliability.

## üìö Research Opportunities

Sudoku4LLM provides a unique opportunity to advance research in the following areas:

### 1. **Optimal Representation of Structured Data**
   - Explore different serialization methods for structured or semi-structured data.
   - Evaluate how cell-level, row-level, column-level, or grid-level representations impact LLM reasoning performance.

### 2. **Reasoning Over Tabular Data**
   - Study how LLMs handle tabular or grid-like data, which is common in real-world applications (e.g., spreadsheets, databases).
   - Develop best practices for adapting LLMs to structured data reasoning tasks.

### 3. **Chain of Thought (CoT) Optimization**
   - Use Sudoku puzzles to train and evaluate CoT prompting strategies.
   - Experiment with curriculum learning techniques to improve reasoning depth.

### 4. **Benchmarking Reasoning LLMs**
   - Use Sudoku puzzles as a benchmark for comparing reasoning capabilities across different LLM architectures and training strategies.
